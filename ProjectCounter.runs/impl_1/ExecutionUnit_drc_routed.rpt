2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/CM01/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__1/O, cell CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/CS01/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2/O, cell CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/CS01/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/CS01/LED_out_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell CU/CS01/LED_out_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_2__0/O, cell CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__1 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}
    CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}
    CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}
    CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
