WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net CU/DBSEC/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/DBSEC/COUNT[3]_i_3__0/O, cell CU/DBSEC/COUNT[3]_i_3__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
