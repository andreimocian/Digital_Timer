2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/DBSEC/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/DBSEC/COUNT[3]_i_3__0/O, cell CU/DBSEC/COUNT[3]_i_3__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CU/DBSTOP/T is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CU/DBSTOP/temp_i_2/O, cell CU/DBSTOP/temp_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net EU/CU/CM01/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin EU/CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__2/O, cell EU/CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net EU/CU/CM01/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin EU/CU/CM01/LED_out_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell EU/CU/CM01/LED_out_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net EU/CU/CS01/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin EU/CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2__0/O, cell EU/CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net EU/CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin EU/CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_3/O, cell EU/CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CU/DBSEC/COUNT[3]_i_3__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    EU/CU/CS01/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS01/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS01/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS01/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CU/DBSTOP/temp_i_2 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    CU/TFFEN/temp_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT EU/CU/CM01/COUNT[3]_i_2__2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    EU/CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM10/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT EU/CU/CS01/COUNT[3]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    EU/CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CS10/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#5 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT EU/CU/CS10/COUNT[3]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    EU/CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[0] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[1] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[2] {FDCE}
    EU/CU/CM01/COUNT_reg[3] {FDCE}
